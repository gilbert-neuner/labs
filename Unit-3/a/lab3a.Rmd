## Conducting experiments

- Previously in class, you conducted an experiment to gauge how a stimulus affected people's perception of time.
    - Some people were given a treatment, others were not.
- In this lab, we'll use the data cycle to analyze the _research question_:

_Does the stimulus your class chose change people's perception of time?_


## Coming up with questions

- **Write down two statistical investigative questions that will help you answer the _research question_ from the previous slide.**
- <span class="blue">Then, _export_, _upload_, _import_ your experiment data into RStudio.</span>
    - If you're having trouble coming up with good statistical investigative questions, try loading the data and looking at the variables.
    - Ask yourself, _How would I use these variables to answer the research question?_


## Analyzing our data

- <span class="blue">Create appropriate plots to answer your statistical investigative questions.</span>
- **Are there any outliers or unusual observations that require some cleaning before you can interpret your plots?**
- <span class="blue">Calculate appropriate numerical summaries to answer your statistical investigative questions.</span>
- **Write down a few sentences interpreting your plots and summaries.**


## Wrapping it up

- Is it possible your initial results occurred by chance alone?
    - <span class="blue">Use repeated shuffling to determine how likely the typical difference between the two groups occurred by chance alone.</span>
    - **Create a plot and use it to justify your answer.**
- What do you conclude about the _research question_?
    - **Write a report using the plots and analysis you conducted to answer the _research question_.**
    - Be sure to describe how you conducted your experiment.
