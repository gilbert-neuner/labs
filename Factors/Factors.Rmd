## Overview

<ul>

<li>In R, **data frames** are a versatile way for storing data. One major advantage of data frames is that their columns can be of different types. That is, while some columns can store **numeric data**, other columns can store **categorical data**.</li>

<li>The best way to store a column of categorical data is using data structure called a **factor**. In this lab we will learn to work with factors.</li>

</ul>

## Factors and levels

<ul>

<li>A factor is a lot like a vector, except it has an additional attribute called **levels**. The levels are the different values that the factor is allowed to take on.</li>

<li>The `str` function can be used to check which columns of a data frame are stored as factors, and how many levels they have.</li>

<li>**Which columns of the `cdc` dataset are stored as factors? How many levels do they have?**</li>

<li>**Run the following code to extract `grade` from `cdc` as a factor.** (Don't worry about what the code means for now).</li>

```{r, eval = FALSE}
grade <- cdc %>%
  pull(grade)
```

<li>To see the levels of a factor, you can print its name in the console or pass its name as an argument to the `levels` function.</li>

<li>**How many levels does `grade` have? What are the levels of `grade`?**</li>

</ul>

## Why factors?

<ul>

<li>So, why do we care about factors? Couldn't we just use character vectors?</li>

<li>There are a few main advantages to factors:</li>

  <ul>
  
  <li>Factors are more **memory efficient** than character vectors, because they internally store categorical values as integers. This saves time when dealing with large datasets.</li>
  
  <li>By disallowing categories that weren't specified by the levels, factors ensure **data consistency**. Typos and unexpected categories are prevented.</li>
  
  <li>Certain **statistical functions** such as `lm` recognize factors as categorical variables, but might deal with character vectors incorrectly.</li>
  
  <li>Perhaps most importantly (for us), factors are useful when you want to display character vectors in a **non-alphabetical order**.</li>
  
  </ul>

</ul>

## Example

<ul>

<li>To see why we might prefer factors, let's consider an example using the `surveys` dataset.</li>

<li>**Use the `str` function to view the `str`ucture of `surveys`. Does it contain any factors? How is the `favorite_product` column stored?**</li>

<li>Suppose we were interested in seeing a `bargraph` of the `favorite_product` column. Then we might run</li>

```{r, eval = FALSE}
bargraph(~favorite_product, data = surveys)
```

<li>Notice that the columns are listed alphabetically. What if we wanted to list the columns in a different order?</li>

<li>To do so, we will have to turn the `favorite_product` column into a factor, and specify an order for the levels.</li>

  <ul>
  
  <li>The `factor` function is used to turning character vectors into factors. It takes two arguments. The first is the character vector you would like to convert into a factor. The second is the levels of your new factor, **in the order you want them to be displayed**.</li>
  
  </ul>
  
<li>**Run the code below and then create another bargraph of `size`. What order are the columns displayed in?**</li>

```{r, eval = FALSE}
surveys <- surveys %>%
  mutate(
    favorite_product = factor(favorite_product, levels = c("T-shirt", "Sweater", "Hoodie", "Cardigan", "Button-up", "Blouse"))
  )
```

<li>**Create a new bargraph of `favorite_product`, using a different column ordering of your choosing.**</li>

</ul>

## droplevels

<ul>

<li>Suppose we are interested in creating a bargraph of the number of `9th grade` and `10th grade` students in the `cdc` dataset. Then we might run</li>

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# filter out observations that aren't 9th or 10th graders
underclassmen <- cdc %>%
  filter(grade == "9th grade" | grade == "10th grade")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# create a bargraph
bargraph(~grade, data = underclassmen)
```

<li>Notice that the bargraph still contains columns for the `grade`s that are no longer present in the data. Why did this happen?</li>

<li>Recall from earlier that the `grade` column is stored as a factor, with 5 levels: one for 9th through 12th grade each, and one for other. Even though we filtered out every instance of `11th grade`, `12th grade`, and other from `grade`, we did not tell R that `11th grade`, `12th grade`, and other are no longer levels of `grade`. When we create the bargraph, R thinks we should have a column for every level, including the empty ones.</li>

<li>How do we remove the empty levels from `grade` so that these columns don't appear in a bargraph?</li>

<li>The `droplevels` function takes a factor and drops its empty levels.</li>

<li>**Run the code below and then recreate the bargraph of `grade` using the new `underclassmen` dataset. Which columns are included in the bargraph?**</li>

```{r, eval = FALSE}
underclassmen <- underclassmen %>%
  mutate(
    grade = droplevels(grade)
  )
```

</ul>

## stringsAsFactors

<ul>

<li>Suppose we wanted to initialize a data frame. We might do so with the following code.</li>

```{r, eval = FALSE}
animal_weights <- data.frame(
  animal = c("Dog", "Dog", "Cat", "Cat", "Horse", "Horse"),
  weight = c(100, 150, 8, 11, 900, 1200)
)
```

<li>**Use the `str` function to check how the columns of `animal_weights` are stored. Notice any problems?**</li>

<li>You may have noticed that the animal column is stored as a character vector. We would like for it to be stored as a factor, since `animal` is a categorical variable with three levels.</li>

<li>One way to change the `animal` column into a factor is by mutating it, like in slide 5.</li>

<li>If we wanted `animal` to be stored as a factor from the get go, we could include the `stringsAsFactors` argument when initializing the data frame.</li>

<li>**Run the code below. What is `animal` stored as?**</li>

```{r, eval = FALSE}
animal_weights <- data.frame(
  animal = c("Dog", "Dog", "Cat", "Cat", "Horse", "Horse"),
  weight = c(100, 150, 8, 11, 900, 1200),
  stringsAsFactors = TRUE
)
```

<li>Functions which create data frames, such as `data.frame` and `read.csv`, usually have a `stringsAsFactors` argument, which by default is set to `FALSE`. I.e., when these functions see character vectors, they will store them as character vectors. To override this behavior, you can set `stringsAsFactors` to `TRUE`.</li>

</ul>
